T. Generate multiple country math goals and compare:
    France, Italy, Finland, Japan, China, India

T. Get some feedback using chatGpto model on the goals

T. Once set the high level goals in the readme complete the goals.txt with details about each topi
T. Then create a section for each topic
    Include the projects/problems/tasks
    Material that they can use to learn about it
    
T. Get the agile manifesto and adapt it for our math curriculum
    Understanding over Procedure
    Make sense over result




Emphasis on problem-solving and reasoning skills through hands-on, open-ended problems and collaborative 
learning experiences rather than just procedures and rules.

Emphasis on teaching mathematics in a context that is relevant to the students' lives and future careers. 
Integrate mathematical concepts often into various subjects, such as science and social studies. 

Conceptual understanding vs. procedural knowledge: 
The balance between teaching conceptual understanding and procedural knowledge varies among countries. 
While France and Italy may focus more on memorizing rules and procedures for solving mathematical 
problems, Finland, Japan, and China tend to place a greater emphasis on developing deep, conceptual understanding through exploration 
and inquiry-based learning.

Use of technology: There are differences in the use of technology among these countries. For example, some Asian countries like 
Japan and China have incorporated technology into their math classrooms to help students visualize abstract concepts and solve complex 
problems more efficiently. In contrast, European countries might rely more on traditional teaching methods and physical manipulatives 
for learning mathematical concepts.

Flexibility in the curriculum: The flexibility of the curriculum also varies among these countries. For instance, India has a more 
flexible curriculum that allows teachers to tailor their instruction to meet the needs of individual students. In contrast, Japan tends 
to follow a more rigid, standardized curriculum with limited room for adaptation based on student needs or teacher discretion.

Focus on mental math skills: Some countries like China and India place a strong emphasis on mental arithmetic skills, while other 
countries like France and Italy might focus more on using written methods for calculations. Japan tends to strike a balance between 
mental math skills and the use of written methods for solving problems.
