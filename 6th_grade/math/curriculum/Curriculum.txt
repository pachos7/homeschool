Week 1/2 - Introduction to Algebra

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Review missing number problems with addition for example:
"If i read three books how many more books do I need to read to complete 10?"
3 + ? = 10

Solve the problem using the math that you currently know. 
Then discuss about the concepts of Equation and Variable, focus on how an equation represents a balance, you can use the example of a scale to illustrate the point.
Also review how adding something to one side of the scale can be balanced by adding
the same on the other side, and also how removing something on one side can be
balanced by removing the same on the other side.

Rewrite the equation introducing the x variable:

3 + x = 10

This is balanced, we can introduce changes on both sides, for example substracting 3 on both sides:

3 + x - 3 = 10 - 3 

Then we can resolve some of the operations:

3 + x - 3 = 7

Also we can reorganize the left side:

x + 3 - 3 = 7 

And we can now resolve on the left side:

x = 7 


And that way we can find the 'solution'


notice how we 'isolated the variable'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's try missing problems with multiplication:
"If your mom gives you 13 dollars every day, how many days until you can save 91 dollars?"

Try writting an equation that represents that:

13 * ? = 91

13 * x = 91 

(13 * x) / 13 = 91 / 13

13/13 * x = 7

1 * x = 7

x = 1


Building triangle telescopes
With 3 single sheets of paper of different sizes use math to build triangular telescopes,
make sure you leave a centimeter at the end of the page as a flap to close your telescope,
use the power of math to measure how the divide your page in three equal parts.


First we will split out letter size paper in 3 parts like this:

 ---------------------------------
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |----------------|
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
 ---------------------------------

Then we are going to use the biggest part of paper first and we are going to try to build a triagular paper telescope by folding the paper. As we need to glue one of the ends we need to leave space for a flap. Let's make that flap be 1 cm. for the rest of the telescope we need to divide the paper in 3, use math to figure out how big each one of the sides should be:

 ----------------
|                |
|                |x
|----------------|
|                |
|                |x
|----------------|
|                |
|                |x
|----------------|
|----------------|1


To make the triangle we need 3 equal part of an unknown size, let's all it x. That plus the 1 cm that we'd use for the flap would equal the total length of the paper. then we have that : x + x + x + 1 = lenght of the paper. So 3*x + 1 = lenght.

If we measure the length let's say 21 cm we'd have this equation 3*x + 1 = 21.5

To find the value of x we'd need to isolate the x, we'd start by removing the 1, to do so we can substract 1 on the left side, to keep our equation balanced we'd have to substract 1 on the right side too: 3*x + 1 - 1 = 21.5 - 1
                       3*x + 0     = 20.5
                       3*x         = 20.5
Now to remove the 3 we'd have divide by 3 on the left side, so we'd also divide by 3 on the right side:

              3*x    20.5
              ---  = ----
               3       3


                     20.5
              1*x  = ----
                      3


                   20.5
              x  = ----
                     3


              x  = 6.83


So we'd have to to make our sides be 6.83 so that: 6.83 + 6.83 + 6.83 + 1 = 21.5

This way we can build our triangular telescope.

If we take the other piece of paper and apply the same logic we can build other two triangles. Remember to keep the 1 cm for the flap. Make sure you use on of the the remainder papers on the long side and the other one on the short side like this:


|----------------|
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|----------------|

|----------------|
|                |
|----------------|
|                |
|----------------|
|                |
|----------------|
-----------------

We can use the same equation 3*x + 1 = lenght with the only difference that the length would be different for these.

So for the first one:

3*x + 1 = 14

Which solving:
    14 - 1    13 
x = ------ = --- = 4.3
       3      3


For the second one:

3*x + 1 = 10.8

Which solving:
    10.8 - 1   9.8 
x = -------- = --- = 3.26
        3       3


Go ahead and build thesre three triangles, observe how we use the same equation to solve the same problem just by changing the lenght, could we do more triangles?

Try fitting the thriangles one inside each other to create a triangular telescope.


As a second activity let's try to create a table with different sizes sizes.

For a triangle of zise 4 we would have that 3 * 4 + 1 = 13, the length of the paper would nee to be 13.

side length 4 -> 3 * 4 + 1 = 13
side length 5 -> 3 * 5 + 1 = 16
side length 6 -> 3 * 6 + 1 = 19
side length 7 -> 3 * 7 + 1 = 22
side length 8 -> 3 * 8 + 1 = 25

We could find the size of the paper required for any of the sides size.

Let's put this in a graph:

leght of paper
25|                              X
24|

# 6th Grade Math Guide: Understanding the Equation y = 100 - 3x

## Introduction

Welcome to our math lesson! Today, we're going to learn about equations and how they can help us solve everyday problems. Specifically, we’ll explore the equation \( y = 100 - 3x \). This equation helps us understand how a quantity changes over time. 

Let's break it down:
- **\( y \)** represents the amount we have left.
- **\( x \)** represents the number of days.
- **100** is the starting amount.
- **3** is the amount we lose or use each day.

We’ll use a fun example involving LEGO bricks to see how this equation works!

## Practical Example: LEGO Bricks

Imagine you have a total of 100 LEGO bricks. Each day, you use 3 LEGO bricks to build different things. We can use the equation \( y = 100 - 3x \) to find out how many LEGO bricks you have left at any given day.

### Step-by-Step Example:

1. **Day 0 (when you haven’t used any LEGO bricks yet):**
   - Plug in \( x = 0 \) into the equation: 
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 0
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100
     \]
   - So, you have 100 LEGO bricks left.

2. **Day 1 (after using LEGO bricks for 1 day):**
   - Plug in \( x = 1 \) into the equation:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 1
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 = 97
     \]
   - You have 97 LEGO bricks left.

3. **Day 2 (after using LEGO bricks for 2 days):**
   - Plug in \( x = 2 \) into the equation:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 2
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100 - 6 = 94
     \]
   - You have 94 LEGO bricks left.

4. **Day 3 (after using LEGO bricks for 3 days):**
   - Plug in \( x = 3 \) into the equation:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 3
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100 - 9 = 91
     \]
   - You have 91 LEGO bricks left.

### Practice Problems:

1. **Day 5:**
   - How many LEGO bricks do you have left?
   - \( y = 100 - 3 \times 5 \)
   - Simplify and solve.

2. **Day 7:**
   - How many LEGO bricks do you have left?
   - \( y = 100 - 3 \times 7 \)
   - Simplify and solve.

## Graphing the Equation

Now let's see what the equation looks like when we graph it. 

### Creating the Graph:

1. **Draw the Axes:**
   - Draw a horizontal line (the x-axis) and a vertical line (the y-axis). 

2. **Label the Axes:**
   - The x-axis is the number of days.
   - The y-axis is the number of LEGO bricks left.

3. **Plot Points:**
   - Day 0: \( (0, 100) \)
   - Day 1: \( (1, 97) \)
   - Day 2: \( (2, 94) \)
   - Day 3: \( (3, 91) \)

4. **Connect the Dots:**
   - Draw a straight line through the points. This line shows how the number of LEGO bricks decreases over time.

### Graph Example:
```
   | 
100|* (0, 100)
   |
 90|      *
   |        *
 80|          *
   |
   +----------------
     0  1  2  3  4  (days)
```

The line slopes downward because each day, you’re using up LEGO bricks, so the amount left decreases.

## Conclusion

By understanding the equation \( y = 100 - 3x \) and graphing it, we can see how the number of LEGO bricks decreases over time. Equations like this are powerful tools that help us solve real-world problems and make predictions about different situations.

Try using this equation with other examples, like how much money you have left if you spend a certain amount each week, or how much time is left if you spend a certain amount of time each day on a project. Keep practicing and have fun with math!
