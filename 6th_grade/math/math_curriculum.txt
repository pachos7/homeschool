   - Use properties of operations to generate equivalent expressions, simplify expressions, and solve equations.
   - Perform operations with fractions, decimals, and mixed numbers, including adding and subtracting fractions with like denominators and multiplying fractions by whole numbers.
   - Solve real-world problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and number relationships.

2. Ratios and Proportional Relationships (RP)
   - Understand the concept of a ratio and use ratios to solve problems involving fractions and whole numbers.
   - Analyze proportional relationships between quantities.
   - Solve real-world problems involving ratios, rates, and percentages.

3. The Number System (NS)
   - Understand and apply the properties of integers.
   - Recognize and generate sequences that follow arithmetic or geometric patterns.
   - Determine if a given number is prime or composite and find prime factors and multiples.
   - Use the order of operations to perform calculations involving expressions with multiple operations.

4. Expressions and Equations (EE)
   - Write expressions that describe mathematical properties and solve problems using these expressions.
   - Solve linear equations in one variable, including those that require algebraic techniques such as graphing or the use of variables.
