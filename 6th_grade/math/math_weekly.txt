Week 1/2 - Introduction to Algebra
[4. Expressions and Equations (EE)]

Review missing number problems with addition for example:
"If i read three books how many more books do I need to read to complete 10?"
3 + ? = 10

Solve the problem using the math that you currently know. 
Then discuss about the concepts of Equation and Variable, focus on how an equation represents a balance, you can use the example of a scale to illustrate the point.
Also review how adding something to one side of the scale can be balanced by adding
the same on the other side, and also how removing something on one side can be
balanced by removing the same on the other side.

Rewrite the equation introducing the x variable:

3 + x = 10

This is balanced, we can introduce changes on both sides, for example substracting 3 on both sides:

3 + x - 3 = 10 - 3 

Then we can resolve some of the operations:

3 + x - 3 = 7

Also we can reorganize the left side:

x + 3 - 3 = 7 

And we can now resolve on the left side:

x = 7 


And that way we can find the 'solution'


notice how we 'isolated the variable'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's try missing problems with multiplication:
"If your mom gives you 13 dollars every day, how many days until you can save 91 dollars?"

Try writting an equation that represents that:

13 * ? = 91

13 * x = 91 

(13 * x) / 13 = 91 / 13

13/13 * x = 7

1 * x = 7

x = 1


Building triangle telescopes
With 3 single sheets of paper of different sizes use math to build triangular telescopes,
make sure you leave a centimeter at the end of the page as a flap to close your telescope,
use the power of math to measure how the divide your page in three equal parts.


First we will split out letter size paper in 3 parts like this:

 ---------------------------------
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |----------------|
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
|                |                |
 ---------------------------------

Then we are going to use the biggest part of paper first and we are going to try to build a triagular paper telescope by folding the paper. As we need to glue one of the ends we need to leave space for a flap. Let's make that flap be 1 cm. for the rest of the telescope we need to divide the paper in 3, use math to figure out how big each one of the sides should be:

 ----------------
|                |
|                |x
|----------------|
|                |
|                |x
|----------------|
|                |
|                |x
|----------------|
|----------------|1


To make the triangle we need 3 equal part of an unknown size, let's all it x. That plus the 1 cm that we'd use for the flap would equal the total length of the paper. then we have that : x + x + x + 1 = lenght of the paper. So 3*x + 1 = lenght.

If we measure the length let's say 21 cm we'd have this equation 3*x + 1 = 21.5

To find the value of x we'd need to isolate the x, we'd start by removing the 1, to do so we can substract 1 on the left side, to keep our equation balanced we'd have to substract 1 on the right side too: 3*x + 1 - 1 = 21.5 - 1
                       3*x + 0     = 20.5
                       3*x         = 20.5
Now to remove the 3 we'd have divide by 3 on the left side, so we'd also divide by 3 on the right side:

              3*x    20.5
              ---  = ----
               3       3


                     20.5
              1*x  = ----
                      3


                   20.5
              x  = ----
                     3


              x  = 6.83


So we'd have to to make our sides be 6.83 so that: 6.83 + 6.83 + 6.83 + 1 = 21.5

This way we can build our triangular telescope.

If we take the other piece of paper and apply the same logic we can build other two triangles. Remember to keep the 1 cm for the flap. Make sure you use on of the the remainder papers on the long side and the other one on the short side like this:


|----------------|
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|    |    |    | |
|----------------|

|----------------|
|                |
|----------------|
|                |
|----------------|
|                |
|----------------|
-----------------

We can use the same equation 3*x + 1 = lenght with the only difference that the length would be different for these.

So for the first one:

3*x + 1 = 14

Which solving:
    14 - 1    13 
x = ------ = --- = 4.3
       3      3


For the second one:

3*x + 1 = 10.8

Which solving:
    10.8 - 1   9.8 
x = -------- = --- = 3.26
        3       3


Go ahead and build thesre three triangles, observe how we use the same equation to solve the same problem just by changing the lenght, could we do more triangles?

Try fitting the thriangles one inside each other to create a triangular telescope.


As a second activity let's try to create a table with different sizes sizes.

For a triangle of zise 4 we would have that 3 * 4 + 1 = 13, the length of the paper would nee to be 13.

side length 4 -> 3 * 4 + 1 = 13
side length 5 -> 3 * 5 + 1 = 16
side length 6 -> 3 * 6 + 1 = 19
side length 7 -> 3 * 7 + 1 = 22
side length 8 -> 3 * 8 + 1 = 25

We could find the size of the paper required for any of the sides size.

Let's put this in a graph:

leght of paper
25|                              X
24|               
23|

See how they form a line, we could find other sizes just by tracing a line andf finding the corresponding values

# 6th Grade Math Guide: Understanding the Equation y = 100 - 3x

## Introduction

Welcome to our math lesson! Today, we're going to learn about equations and how they can help us solve everyday problems. Specifically, we’ll explore the equation \( y = 100 - 3x \). This equation helps us understand how a quantity changes over time. 

Let's break it down:
- **\( y \)** represents the amount we have left.
- **\( x \)** represents the number of days.
- **100** is the starting amount.
- **3** is the amount we lose or use each day.

We’ll use a fun example involving LEGO bricks to see how this equation works!

## Practical Example: LEGO Bricks

Imagine you have a total of 100 LEGO bricks. Each day, you use 3 LEGO bricks to build different things. We can use the equation \( y = 100 - 3x \) to find out how many LEGO bricks you have left at any given day.

### Step-by-Step Example:

1. **Day 0 (when you haven’t used any LEGO bricks yet):**
   - Plug in \( x = 0 \) into the equation: 
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 0
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100
     \]
   - So, you have 100 LEGO bricks left.

2. **Day 1 (after using LEGO bricks for 1 day):**
   - Plug in \( x = 1 \) into the equation:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 1
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 = 97
     \]
   - You have 97 LEGO bricks left.

3. **Day 2 (after using LEGO bricks for 2 days):**
   - Plug in \( x = 2 \) into the equation:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 2
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100 - 6 = 94
     \]
   - You have 94 LEGO bricks left.

4. **Day 3 (after using LEGO bricks for 3 days):**
   - Plug in \( x = 3 \) into the equation:
     \[
     y = 100 - 3 \times 3
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     y = 100 - 9 = 91
     \]
   - You have 91 LEGO bricks left.

### Practice Problems:

1. **Day 5:**
   - How many LEGO bricks do you have left?
   - \( y = 100 - 3 \times 5 \)
   - Simplify and solve.

2. **Day 7:**
   - How many LEGO bricks do you have left?
   - \( y = 100 - 3 \times 7 \)
   - Simplify and solve.

## Graphing the Equation

Now let's see what the equation looks like when we graph it. 

### Creating the Graph:

1. **Draw the Axes:**
   - Draw a horizontal line (the x-axis) and a vertical line (the y-axis). 

2. **Label the Axes:**
   - The x-axis is the number of days.
   - The y-axis is the number of LEGO bricks left.

3. **Plot Points:**
   - Day 0: \( (0, 100) \)
   - Day 1: \( (1, 97) \)
   - Day 2: \( (2, 94) \)
   - Day 3: \( (3, 91) \)

4. **Connect the Dots:**
   - Draw a straight line through the points. This line shows how the number of LEGO bricks decreases over time.

### Graph Example:
```
   | 
100|* (0, 100)
   |
 90|      *
   |        *
 80|          *
   |
   +----------------
     0  1  2  3  4  (days)
```

The line slopes downward because each day, you’re using up LEGO bricks, so the amount left decreases.

## Conclusion

By understanding the equation \( y = 100 - 3x \) and graphing it, we can see how the number of LEGO bricks decreases over time. Equations like this are powerful tools that help us solve real-world problems and make predictions about different situations.

Try using this equation with other examples, like how much money you have left if you spend a certain amount each week, or how much time is left if you spend a certain amount of time each day on a project. Keep practicing and have fun with math!

Week 3 - Introduction to Algebra
[4. Expressions and Equations (EE)]

Ask the students to create an equation to represent their age.

Start by relating the idea that the equation is meant to represent the relationship between two values,
in this case the age and the year. The year that a person have would have to do with the year that the
person was born and the year that we are in, so an equation would be a way to represent that relationship
and how it would change overtime.

Introduce the idea of creating tables to represent some of the known values for some of the variables,
for example, I was born in 1980 so i know that in that year I had 0 yeards old, and also on 1981
I was 1 year old. We can represent this in a table:

Year  |1980|1981
------|----|----
My Age| 0  |  1

We could also add some other known values, like I remember that I was 20 years old in 2000 and also 
today in 2024 I'm 44.

Year  |1980|1981|2000|2024
------|----|----|----|----
My Age| 0  |  1 |  20|  44

With the values of that table we could paint a graph that may help us see the behaviour overtime

Age
  45 |                                                    *
  40 |                              
  35 |                             
  30 |                            
  25 |                           
  20 |                             *                      
  15 |                        
  10 |                       
   5 |           
   0 |*
     ----------------------------------------------------------
      1980   1985   1990   1995   2000   2005   2010   2020
                            Year

============  Python  ============ 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data for the graph
years = [1980, 1981, 2000, 2024]
ages = [0, 1, 20, 44]

# Creating the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(years, ages, marker='o', color='blue', linestyle='-', linewidth=2, markersize=8)

# Adding titles and labels
plt.title("Age Progression Over the Years", fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel("Year", fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel("My Age", fontsize=14)

# Adding grid for better readability
plt.grid(True)

# Display the graph
plt.show()
================================== 


Each kid graph would have different numbers, take the opportunity to talk about scale in graphs.
Also share about how to select dependent (Y) and independent (X) variables.
In our case we selected the year as our independent variable A and our age the dependent variable Y,
because it 'feels' that the age depends on the year.

Once you have your problem, your table of values and your graph (best if all together in a single page)
encourage the kids to come up with ideas for equations that would represent this behaviour.
Ask them to 'test' the values on the table to see if selecting a particular year (a value of X) they 
can find out the corresponding Age (value of Y), the right formula should work for all values on the table.

Often kids will come up with the idea that the year they were born + an age would be equal to the year.

Birth-Year + Age = Year; or Birht-Year + y = x
Let's call Birth-Year b, then we have: b + y = x
Now let's isolate the y by subscracting b on both sides: b + y - b = x - b 
regorganizing: y + b - b = x - b ->  y + 0 = x - b -> y = x - b

In my case (because i was born in 1980): y = x - 1980

Trying this with the values from our table:

year 1980, y = 1980 - 1980 = 0
year 1981, y = 1981 - 1980 = 1
year 2000, y = 2000 - 1980 = 20
year 2024, y = 2024 - 1980 = 44

So this is my equation, for each kid the year that they are born is different but the 'shape' of the 
equation would be the same. Encourage them to compare their graphs, tables and equations

Week 4  Analyze proportional relationships between quantities.
[2. Ratios and Proportional Relationships (RP)]


Draw a square of size 16cm x 16cm. Then paint the diagonal of the square like this:

-------------
|         * |
|       *   |
|     *     |
|   *       |
| *         |
|*----------|

Then Using the square and its diagonal paint a triangle with with 2cm and height 2cm, like this:

-------------
|         * |
|       *   |
|     *     |
|   *       |
| * |2      |
|*----------|
   2

Find how much the diagonal on that triangle measures, it should be close to 3 (~2.82).

Then let's create a triangle four times bigger, so its width should be 8, it's heigtn is
also 8, and let's measure our diagonal:

-------------
|         * |
|       *   |
|     * |   |
|   *   |8  |
| *     |   |
|*----------|
     8  
It should be close to 12 (~11,31), notice how when the with grew four times, the height
also grew 4 times and the diagonal also grew four times, meaning that somehow the y are
related.

Try doing the same excercise but growing by different factors, it could be 5 times bigger,
10 times bigger, 7 times bigger etc, when measuring the diagonal it should always be
very close.

Try using legos to do similar measurements, legos are very excact in size so it would help
to do the measuring correctly. Encourage kids to use detailed milimeters to measure.



Activity 1: Scale a drawing.

Make a cuadricule 2cm wide and 4cm tall and have the students make a simple drawing on it. It could be a simple image of a statue or just a letter to fint in the 2x4.

Then ask them to make that same drawing five times bigger. Let them think about how
tall the new image would be and how wide the image would be. Multiplying each dimension by 5 would tell us the new dimension, that would be 10x20.
Have them make the image on the new scale and compare.

Ask them to scale again using something like three and a half times, that means
we'd have to mulitply the original measurements by 3.5. That would be 2x3.5= 7
and 4x3.5=14

This is what we do scale up, we multiply the original dimensions by the number we
want to scale to, invite the students to come up with their own scale up number.


Activity 2: Compare famous building sizes.

Select 3 famous building and compare their sizes, we'd need to scale them down to fit on the page that we are going to use to draw them.

Example:
Giza biggest pyramid: 230m tall
Empire State building: 443m tall
Burj Khalifa building: 828m tall

To scale it down to fit our page we'd have to divide the numbers by a factor,
we need to find out the factor, notice that the measurements of your page may be in 
cm so you'd need to match that by converting the original number in cm.

Let's say for example that we have a page that is 30cm tall, so let's try to fit the
tallest building in it, 828m which is 82800cm which will not fit into our page.
Let's try scaling by half, that'd be 82800cm/2 = 41400cm, doesnt fit, let's try other numbers:

82800cm/2 = 41400cm, doesn't fit
82800cm/20 = 4140cm, doesn't fit
82800cm/200 = 414cm, doesn't fit
82800cm/400 = 207cm, doesn't fit
82800cm/1000 = 82,8cm, doesn't fit
82800cm/2000 = 41,4cm, doesn't fit
82800cm/3000 = 27,6cm, will fit so we will use 3000 to divide our other numbers


Giza biggest pyramid:  230m/3000 = 7,66cm
Empire State building: 443m/3000 = 14,7cm
Burj Khalifa building: 828m/3000 = 27,6cm

Draw rectangles to represent each of the buildings height and compare them.

We have effectively scaled them down by 3000. 
Then our scale is 1cm = 3000cm
or we can also say that 1cm = 30m


»»————————————————————————---------------　★　---------------————————————————————————««
Week 5  Analyze proportional relationships between quantities.
[2. Ratios and Proportional Relationships (RP)]


Activity 1: Build a more detailed scaled down version of a famous builing

This time instead of just using the heigth we will be also using the width of the builiding.
Let's take for example the empire state... this building is made like a 7 layers cake.

Here's the dimensions of each "cake" from bottom to top, first number is the with and second is the heigth:
Layer  1: 129m x 24m
Layer  2: 95,2m x 53,4m
Layer  3: 73,9m x 35,6m
Layer  4: 57,9m x 151,3m
Layer  5: 55,2m x 33m
Layer  6: 47,1m x 35,6m
Layer  7: 44,5m x 4,4m

Scale it down 20 times to paint it on a sheet of paper

Week 6  Representing objects with Lego
[6. Measurement and Data (MD)]

Activity 1: Meters to lego: Find out how to represent the height of 3 buildigins with legos
Example:
Giza biggest pyramid: 230m tall
Empire State building: 443m tall
Burj Khalifa building: 828m tall


Activity 2: Measure my room
Measure the walls of your room. Inititally make a sketch just with the basic shape of the walls
that you can use to write down the measurements, once measure scale it down so that you
can make a drawing now with the measurements that you took

Activity 3: room to legos
Recreate the sorrounding walls of your room using legos, you have to decide which scale to use,
for example you can decide that each lego stub represents 10 centimeters.
Focus on doing only the sorrounding walls, later on when you ge the time you could also measure
the walls, windows, doors and other objects on your room to add more detail to it.
Remember to always take notes on your scetch of the original measurement and the scaled measurement.

Week 8 - Understanding Probability with Dice
    [Measurement and Data (MD)]

**Objective:** Students will learn the basics of probability by conducting experiments with dice.

**Materials Needed:**
- Standard six-sided dice (one per student or group)
- Paper and pencil for recording results
- Chart or graph paper for data representation

**Instructions:**

1. **Introduction to Probability:**
   - Explain the concept of probability as the likelihood of an event occurring, ranging from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain).
   - Discuss the probability formula: P(E) = {Number of favorable outcomes}/{Total possible outcomes

2. **Roll the Dice:**
   - Have each student or group roll a die a set number of times (e.g., 30 rolls).
   - Record the results of each roll.

3. **Calculate Frequencies:**
   - Count how many times each number (1 through 6) appears.
   - Calculate the experimental probability for each outcome using the formula above.

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Create a chart or graph to visually represent the results. Compare experimental probabilities with theoretical probabilities 1/6 for each number.
   - Discuss any discrepancies between experimental and theoretical probabilities.

5. **Reflection:**
   - Engage students in a discussion about factors affecting probability, such as randomness and sample size.
   - Encourage them to think about how probability is used in real-life scenarios.

This hands-on activity allows students to delve into probability concepts through direct experience with data collection and analysis!

Week 9 - Probability concepts
    [Measurement and Data (MD)]

* Event
    Things that happen, there are certain events that we are certain will happen like: we are certain that 
    the sun will rise tomorrow. There are other events that we are certain that will not happen, like:
    It's impossible that i will grow 3 meters tall.
    There are events that we can't be sure about like: We are not sure if it will be sunny tomorrow or
    we can't be sure that we will get a call tomorrow.

* Chance
    Refers to the likelihood or possibility of an event happening.
    It can be expressed in words, such as "likely," "unlikely," "certain," or "impossible."
    For example if Carlos is a good runner we may say "Carlos has a good chance of winning the race"
    Sometimes a number is used to tell the chace of something happening.


* Probability 
    A way of quantifying chance. It tells us numerically how likely an event is to occur.
    Probability is a number between 0 and 1:
        0 means the event will not happen (impossible).
        1 means the event will definitely happen (certain).
        1/2 or 0.5 means the event will happen half of the time
    Probabilities can be written as a fraction, as a decimal or as a percent, for example these thre are the same:
        1/5 probability
        0.2 probability
        20% probability

Week 10 - Number Line and properties of Integers
    [3. The Number System (NS)]


The number line
Is a visual way to represent numbers. It is a straight line with numbers placed at equal intervals. The center of the number line is zero (0), and numbers to the right of zero are positive, while numbers to the left are negative.

Here's a simple number line for reference:
<--- -3 --- -2 --- -1 --- 0 --- 1 --- 2 --- 3 --->

- Positive numbers: These are numbers greater than zero (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.).
- Negative numbers: These are numbers less than zero (e.g., -1, -2, -3, etc.).
- Zero (0): Zero is neither positive nor negative. It separates positive and negative numbers.

Activity 1, Integer Number Line 
    Draw a number line ranging from -10 to +10.
    Place integers they encounter in their daily life (e.g., temperatures, scores) on the number line.
    Discuss how integers can represent both positive and negative values.


- Properties of Integers:

    Commutative Property:
        Definition: Changing the order of numbers does not change the sum or product.
        Examples: 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 and 4 × 2 = 2 × 4
        In general we can say that: 
            a + b = b + a
            a * b = b * a

        Practical Example: If you have 3 apples and 5 oranges, you can count 5 oranges first or 3 apples first, and you will have 8 fruits either way.

    Associative Property:
        Definition: Changing the grouping of numbers does not change the sum or product.
        Example:  ( 2 + 3 ) + 4 = 2 + ( 3 + 4) and  ( 2 × 3 ) × 4 = 2 × ( 3 × 4)
        In general we can say that: 
            a + b + c = (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)
            a * b * c = (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)
        Practical Example: When baking, if you mix 2 cups of flour and 3 cups of sugar, then add 4 eggs, it doesn’t matter if you mix the flour and sugar first or add the eggs later.

        Beware: while mixing multiplication and addition
            (3 + 4) * 5 != 3 + (4 * 5)
                 7  * 5 != 3 + 20
                     35 != 23

    Identity Property:
        Definition: The sum of any integer and zero is the integer; the product of any integer and one is the integer.
        Example: 5 + 0 = 5 and 7 × 1 = 7
        Practical Example: If you have 7 dollars and spend 0 dollars, you still have 7 dollars.

    Distributive Property:
        Definition: Multiplying a number by a sum is the same as doing each multiplication separately.
        Example:  3 * (2 + 4) = (3 * 2) + (3 * 4)
        Practical Example: If you buy 3 packs of gum at $2 each and 3 packs at $4 each, you can add the prices before multiplying, or multiply separately.
